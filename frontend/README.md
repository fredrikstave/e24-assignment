# Standard Code Test
## Frontend application
This is the React frontend application part of the assignement.

It's built with React and Redux, and to run the application, simply do the following.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Then `npm start`
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

If you setup the backend application and it doesn't run on port 8000, you'll have to make a simple adjustment to get the application to run.
Open the file `src/env.js` and update the `BACKEND_URL` constant with the correct port.
If you want to run the backend on a virtual machine you'll probably have to update the address as well.

If you encounter any problems running the program, just drop me an e-mail and I'll assist you.

Enjoy!
