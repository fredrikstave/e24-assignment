# Standard Code Test
To run the project, do the following:

1. Open two terminal windows.
2. In one window, navigate to the `backend` folder.
3. Run `composer install`.
4. When the installer is finished, run `php bin/console server:run`.
5. In your other window, navigate to the `frontend` folder.
6. Run `npm install`.
    6.1. If you don't already have `react-scripts` installed, you'll need to run the following `npm install -g create-react-app` to install it. Without this package you'll not be able to proceed to step 7.
7. When the install is complete, run `npm start`.
8. The backend should run on `localhost:8000` and the frontend should run at `localhost:3000`.
9. Open your web browser and go to `localhost:3000` to test out the application.
