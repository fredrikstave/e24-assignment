# E24 programming assignment
This is my programming assignment to get qualified as a candidate for the developer opening currently available.

To run the project you can do either of the following:

1. Run `npm install` and `composer install` within the same directory as this README file
2. Excecute `docker run`
3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

If you don't have Docker installed or if you for some reason would prefer running the project locally
on your own machine, you can do the following.

1. Run `npm install` and `composer install` within the same directory as this README file
2. `cd` into `backend`
3. Run `php bin/console serve`
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

If you have any problems running the program, just drop me an e-mail, and I'll assist you.

Enjoy!
