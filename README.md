# Standard Code Test
To run the project, do the following:

1. Open two terminal windows.
2. In one window, navigate to the `backend` folder.
3. Run `php bin/console server:run`.
4. In your other window, navigate to the `frontend` folder.
5. Run `npm install`.
6. When the install is complete, run `npm start`.
7. The backend should run on `localhost:8000` and the frontend should run at `localhost:3000`.
8. Open your web browser and go to `localhost:3000` to test out the application.

If you have any problems running the program, just drop me an e-mail, and I'll assist you.
